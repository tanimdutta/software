# Audio Deep Fake Project
**The project has not still completed, please visit after one month again. Partial results are in output folders, input korean and output other languages. Once audio translation part will be over Video regenration will be appended.**

(We are thankful to Mr. Lee Min Ho of MYM Entertainment and leeminhofilms for being the inspiration for this work.)

(This application will be used to translate and dub movies and TV shows into multiple languages, with deepfake technology synchronizing actors' lip movements with dubbed audio. This innovation will enhance the quality of dubbed content, making it more natural and immersive for international audiences. By reducing the need for costly and time-consuming re-shoots and ADR sessions, this technology will save time and money while expanding the global reach of multimedia content, thus transforming the localization process in the entertainment industry.)

**Multi-Speaker audio translation**: This Python project provides functionality for real-time multi speakers audio translation using two different methods. It utilizes speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech libraries to enable translation between different languages. This code works on python 3.10, We have not tested it on other versions. Some older versions will have issues.

**Features** : 
Diarization and Cloning.

Real-time Translation: The application translates speech input into the desired target language in real-time.

User Interaction: User-friendly interface with instructions for interaction.

Flexibility: Easily change target languages and adjust settings according to user requirements.
